<h1>The Best Movies According to William</h1>>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
<p>This movie is about a dystopian England.  I love the difficulty of having to act behind a mask that Hugo Weaving provides.  In an interview he discusses how he had to learn to project his emotions that he would normally show in his facial expressions through his voice.</p>
<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<p>An extraordinary story about a big fish.  It seems like the normal tale told about encountering a big fish that is embellished by fishermen, but in the end the storytellers grandchildren learn the truth.</p>
<h3>Second Hand Lions</h3>
<p>A tale of adventure told by two aging men to their estranged grandchild.  Along the way the young child learns that the tale spun by these two old men is indeed factual.</p>
